# Apache ECharts 5.5.0 Features

## Enhanced ESM Support

This feature is a significant change to the default ESM package, specifically designed for developer testing and Node.js usage in module customization scenarios.

Previously, ECharts only exported `*.esm` files in npm (in the lib directory of the npm package). While this worked well in bundlers, it didn’t perform as well in the Node.js runtime and some Node.js-based testing frameworks like vitest and jest.

With this new feature, we’ve made several changes to improve this:

- Added `"type": "module"` to package.json
- Added `"exports": {...}"` to package.json
- Added some `package.json` files to the sub-directory, which only contain `"type": "commonjs"`.

These changes mean that files like `echarts/core.js` can now be resolved as ESM in environments like pure Node.js, vitest, jest, and create-react-app.

Please note that if using `"exports"`, the files that are not declared in "exports" will be invisible from outside any more. Also, the path must start with `'.'`.

We’ve also ensured that this new feature is compatible with a variety of environments, including runtime (node / vitest / jest(create-react-app) / ssr / …) and bundlers (webpack / rollup / vite / esbuild / …).

We’re excited about this new feature and believe it will significantly improve the developer experience.
